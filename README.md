Open AI was founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk with a 1 billion dollar pledge from investors. The goal of this company is to create Artificial General intelligence that is  not only smarter than humans but also beneficial to them too. OpenAi’s intended customers are the average everyday person so that anyone can have access to advanced AI allowing it to become one with society. OpenAI’s greatest advantage over its competitor is that OpenAi is a Non-profit organization that ensures investors cannot make more than a 100% return on investments, which allows them to put all of their profits into further research and development.

OpenAI specializes in Artificial Intelligence. Some of the major innovations in this field include OpenAi’s own Release of ChatGPT, Google’s photo editing AI, there is also a trend among businesses partially due to the success of OpenAI to try their own hand in AI systems like Microsoft and Meta AI. OpenAI also had a hand in creating laws surrounding AI with them testifying in Congress back in June 2019. OpenAI is the most successful company in this field with them creating many AI innovations and having an estimated value of 157 Billion.

OpenAI is the leading in its field and has the most well known AI service being ChatGPT which anyone can use completely for free. The only OpenAI could do differently as a Non-profit organization would be to gain the knowledge of researchers outside the USA and in the form of a service would be to host competition with monetary rewards that anyone across the globe could enter with the hope that the competition winner is able to create an innovation that pushes the Artificial Intelligence field forwards. This can be done with technologies that already exist and are widely available like GitHub and Kaggle, due to their usage in allowing programmers to share code and collaborate on projects together.
